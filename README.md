# Photovoltaic Efficiency Visualizer
Visualizes key areas of effiency of a solar cell from a heatmap. In reality, a generated heatmap would not be used, but for testing and demonstration purposes this project randomly generates a heatmap resembling one of a solar cells efficiency with a few clusters of efficiency and some clusters of failure. The solarcell file reads in the generated heatmap and converts it to grayscale intensity using the formula: grayscale_intensity = 0.299 * df['R'] + 0.587 * df['G'] + 0.114 * df['B']. This allows each pixel on the heatmap to be measured in one value. Using the grayscale intensity, a derivative heatmap showing the areas where the slope is the most extreme is created. Both the derivative heatmap and the original heatmap are run through a function the edit the heatmap and draw on it to show the areas of interest, creating a new image with the areas of interest highlighted. Additionally, a correlation is run between the derivative and the original heatmap.


While the areas of interest may seem obvious, it is important to be able to automate this when 1000s of solar cells are being tested for efficiency.
